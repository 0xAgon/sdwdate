Description: Secure Distributed Network Time Synchronization
 Time keeping is crucial for security, privacy, and anonymity. Sdwdate
 distributes trust among three types of servers (Friendly, Neutral, and
 Hostile), using the median time of those servers.
 .
 If too many of the servers are offline, the clock is untouched. It runs at
 randomized intervals to avoid fingerprinting (which would reveal that one is
 not only a sdwdate user but also a Tor user). Since it does not require UDP, it
 can work over the Tor network.
 .
 Plugins are supported via hooks. These hooks include pre-connect, pre-fetch,
 post-success, post-failure, and progress. Sdwdate comes without a GUI, but one
 could be added as a plugin.
